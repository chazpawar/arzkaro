## 💡 Key Concepts

### Fast Refresh (Hot Reload)

Most code changes reload automatically without rebuilding. No need to rebuild the app every time!

### When to Rebuild

- Installing native packages
- Changing app.json
- Modifying build configuration

See: [When to Rebuild vs When to Just Reload](./DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md#when-to-rebuild-vs-when-to-just-reload)

### Build Types

- **Development Build** (`pnpm run ios`) - Daily development
- **EAS Local Build** - Testing production builds
- **Production Build** - App Store release

See: [Understanding Build Types](./DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md#understanding-build-types)
